# Installing Local PDs

1. Ensure that the Windows user account that is currently logged in has Administrator access rights. 
2. Connect the USB cable from the Local PD to the PC. 
3. Verify that the drivers are downloaded and installed automatically. 

**NOTE!**

Make a note of the assigned COM port that is displayed in the notification area. When logging in to CWM, select the assigned COM port if CWM fails to find the COM port automatically.

Example: `STMicroelectronics Virtual COM Port (COM7)`
 
If the drivers are not installed automatically, contact technical support.

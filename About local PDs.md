Local PDs are used to authenticate administrators of a locking system when logging in to, and programming keys in administration software such as CLIQâ„¢ Web Manager (CWM).

A Local PD has two key slots; the left slot is for C-keys and the right slot is for user keys. To login, the administrator inserts a C-key in a Local PD that is connected via a USB port to a PC with the administration software.
